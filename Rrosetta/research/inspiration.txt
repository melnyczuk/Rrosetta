    -- "In his paper, “Emergence and Generative Art,” Gordon Monro, a generative artist and PhD candidate in generative art at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, reviewed various notions of emergence before giving his own definition relating to generative art. Monro’s emergence is behavior or output that is “unobvious or difficult to predict” and “evokes feelings of surprise-wonder-mysteryautonomy.” Monro emphasizes that these characteristics need to persist despite our knowledge or understanding of the generative system, which suggests that the appeal in generative design lies in its surpassing of what can be imagined from its input and setup alone. Though this definition is interesting, it seems too broad and unspecific for a graphic design context. The unpredictability of the end result would not be very conducive to a client-designer relationship, and evoking feelings of surprise does not sufficiently explain why the designer would choose to keep the creation process open. A more specific definition of emergence is needed for it to be adequately researched."
