### -- STRUCTURE PLAN -- ###
----------------------------
1-- build scraper & crawler:
    - stock up on methods for aquiring 'zine' content;

2-- metadata aquisition tools:
    - find robust + accurate ways to access 'user' metadata;

3-- algorithms to analyse this data:
    - [problematic] find robust way to analyse metadata and generate search terms for content;
    - ensure that this is not random--seek consistency (maybe publishing source links at back solves this);

4-- alogrithmic methods for print design:
    - determine how to arrange content;
    - systematise content heirarchy;

5-- build print:
    - hardware for installation, ie, convert old inkjet printer;
    - [TODO] figure out binding mechanism;

6-- online repository:
    - works as documentation of the project as it goes on, leaves something permanent and accessible to show;
