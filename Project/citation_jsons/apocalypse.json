\u00a014And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. \u00a015And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. \u00a016And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. \u00a017So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision. \u00a018Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. \u00a019And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be. \u00a020The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. \u00a021And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. \u00a022Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. \u00a023And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. \u00a024And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. \u00a025And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. \u00a026And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. \u00a027And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it."}, "p_4110855777": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001909/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%208%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\nGo to the top of the page\nYour donations keep the Bible Gateway going\nContact us/Feedback\nPrivacy policy\nTerms of use\n"}, "p_4129918591": {"origin": "http://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/", "text": "Ask\n                  a Librarian\n              Want to ask our reference staff a question about the rare book & special collections?"}, "p_4130949456": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071105030232/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012%3A11%3B&version=9%3B", "text": " Public Domain"}, "p_4137027413": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001654/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=73&chapter=20&verse=10&version=9&context=verse", "text": " \u00a010And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."}, "p_4167558415": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071208232224/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2016%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\n\n"}, "p_4266514640": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071115025210/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%206%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "Revelation 6 \u00a01And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. \u00a02And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. \u00a03And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. \u00a04And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. \u00a05And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see.

the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. \u00a07After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. \u00a08I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. \u00a09I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. \u00a010A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. \u00a011I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. \u00a012As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. \u00a013I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. \u00a014And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. \u00a015I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. \u00a016I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. \u00a017These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. \u00a018But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. \u00a019Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; \u00a020And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. \u00a021I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; \u00a022Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. \u00a023Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. \u00a024And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. \u00a025And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. \u00a026But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. \u00a027And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. \u00a028Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."}, "p_6994459004": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071107115052/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+19%3A20%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\n\n"}, "p_6996344624": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001834/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011%3A3%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\nBibleGateway.com is \u00a9 Copyright 1995-2007 Gospel Communications International\n"}, "p_7137958079": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001909/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%208%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\nBibleGateway.com is \u00a9 Copyright 1995-2007 Gospel Communications International\n"}, "p_7185180748": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071124172435/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A8%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\n\nBuy a Bible and support BibleGateway.com\nEvery Bible purchased at GospelDirect.com supports BibleGateway.com\n"}, "p_719347992": {"origin": "http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/09/29/end-of-the-world-potential-armageddon/", "text": "By        \t\n\t\t            \n\t\t            \t\n\t\t            \t\t\n\t\t            \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t John Brandon\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t                    \n\t\t                 \n\t\t            \n"}, "p_7249447736": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071107115052/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+19%3A20%3B&version=9%3B", "text": " Public Domain"}, "p_7271139729": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001834/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011%3A3%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\n\nBuy a Bible and support BibleGateway.com\nEvery Bible purchased at GospelDirect.com supports BibleGateway.com\n"}, "p_7281717403": {"origin": "https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001732/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%207%2C%208%3B&version=9%3B", "text": "\nBibleGateway.com is \u00a9 Copyright 1995-2007 Gospel Communications International\n"}, "p_7288585051": {"origin": "http://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/", "text": "Blog on the NAWSA Collection: \u201cRoll up your sleeves, set your mind to making history.\u201d\nImage from: The Torch Bearer, 1916.\n            Also see the online NAWSA Collection to view all documents.\n\nFresh Off the Digital Press  \nPassional, das ist Der Heyligen Leben by De VoragineJacobus  and illustrator Albrecht D\u00fcrer.

Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. \u00a016And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. \u00a017And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. \u00a018And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. \u00a019And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. \u00a020And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. \u00a021And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great."}}}
