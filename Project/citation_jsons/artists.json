(Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.)  In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life.  \u201cArt,\u201d in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English \u201cskill\u201d, a sense that has survived in phrases like \u201cthe art of war,\u201d \u201cthe art of love,\u201d and \u201cthe art of medicine.\u201d The usefulness of an art and its products was not limited to the merely utilitarian or decorative (e.g. , cooking, clothing, shelter, personal adornment, or warfare), but also included religious worship, cultural instruction and celebration, memorializing rulers, marking rites of passage, entertainment, and many other functions that linked it with intellectual and cultural life.  Artisans were often honored in this older system, depending on the nature of their craft (painting ranked higher than the writing of plays), and they were certainly able to express themselves individually and make profound statements through their work, as Michelangelo and Shakespeare did.  Nevertheless they practiced a craft, and self-expression was limited to the bounds set by their accountability to their patrons or employers, or in Shakespeare\u2019s case, by what the theater audience would pay to see (TIA,  pp. 47-52)."}, "p_1232388420": {"origin": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00548cd", "text": " Test your knowledge of the subjects covered by In Our Time.

Rather they are grounded in the modern system\u2019s flaws, its internal inconsistencies, its inability to maintain the foundational assumptions on which it rests, the ways in which it clouds our understanding or appreciation of the artistic values and practices of other cultures on their own terms, and the separation of art and life in Western culture for which he holds it partly responsible.  If Shiner is right that the modern system possesses these characteristics, and if they flow, as he claims, from the historically contingent way in which it divides the arts, then he has good grounds to question the universal validity of that system and its assumptions.

But this is a different sort of thriving from that of craftwork in the West before the industrial revolution or in traditional non-Western cultures.  In those settings, craft is necessary for daily life, and skill and grace tend naturally to be valued in combination (within affordable limits).  In the contemporary West and increasingly in the rest of the world, craftwork is not valued because it meets everyday needs but because it is handmade, individual, and different from the mass-produced ordinary.  There is a strong pull to assimilate such work into the category of Fine Art.  One sees advertisements for \u201cFine Craft\u201d shows, and every large city gallery district has galleries which specialize in ceramics, wood turning, fine art furniture, fiber arts, and the like.  Objects are shown, valued and purchased in these galleries in much the same way that paintings and sculptures are.  Consider the example of \u201cYou Da Buddha,\u201d a meditation seat by fine furniture maker Tom Huang. (This and other pieces by Huang may be viewed at:www.wexlergallery.com/wexler.htmlClick on Artists, mouse down to Tom Huang.)  This piece sold recently for a total of $5,000.  The craftsmanship is exquisite, combining skills in woodworking and fiber arts; the object is one of a kind, and its gently ironic blend of humorous title, price, and obvious functionality give it as much meaning as a fine art product might need.  Huang\u2019s website (www2.ku.edu/~sfa/dsgn/industrialdesign/huang/index.shtml) describes his work as \u201cfurniture based sculpture\u201d.  He is an assistant professor of industrial design in a school of fine art, and his work was recently featured in American Craft Magazine.   So he crosses the boundaries of the modern system in several ways.  The sale price of $5,000 for this object is plainly reasonable, given the quality of the piece and the amount of time invested in the making of it by a highly skilled professional.  As art world prices go, it is on the low side.  At that price, especially after the gallery takes its cut, Huang would have difficulty making and selling enough such individual pieces in a year to earn his middle-class salary.  He needs his day job.  On the other hand, a price of $5,000 is forbiddingly high for anyone earning less than a solidly middle-class American income, and thus ironically dissonant with Buddhist ideals of simplicity and nonattachment.

The poor were hardly better off under the traditional system in the West.  Perhaps the question becomes what role all the arts might play, not only in their own transformation but in that of society in general.  There can be no easy answer to this question.  But one can\u2019t help noticing that electronic media have become remarkably affordable and are beginning to spread rapidly outside the developed world.  It is no wild fantasy to suggest that they will be increasingly potent channels for social change.  Walter Benjamin\u2019s speculations about the work of art in the age of mechanical reproducibility seem if anything more relevant now than they were when he first wrote them.  The possibility does exist within those media for very wide-spread participation in these arts, not only in listening or viewing but in production.  And Benjamin\u2019s final question remains equally relevant:  Will the forces of human creativity, intercultural communication and freedom win out, or will these media become primarily agents of propaganda, commercial interests and the reproduction of the status quo?  So long as we are not looking to the arts alone rather than to all segments of society for the answers to these questions, it seems clear, at least to me, that the arts have a crucial contribution to make in our quest.

One of these is the negative value of utility when considering a work of art.  Art is supposed to be made for its own sake, not for some other purpose.  Of course it may serve a purpose; but in the modern system it only counts as Art if it is valuable on its own independent of that purpose.  Shiner gives a number of examples to establish that this expectation is indeed new.  Likewise, the notion of the Artist as Creative Genius is significantly altered in the modern system.  Genius itself is a very old  idea, a version of the idea of divine inspiration.  But in the modern system the artist is a genius rather than being inspired by  a genius, and what genius generates is not so much preternatural skill as innovation beyond rules.  In other words, genius is no longer the characteristic of an artisan.  The third defining idea, that of (autonomously) Aesthetic Appreciation, is likewise radically new (TIA, pp. 130-153, 213-225).  Finally, as already mentioned, the Unity of the Arts is a new thesis, unknown in the past, and it has a major influence on the practice and theory of art.

In the new system, Fine Art (art with a capital \u201cA\u201d) was divided from the crafts as the appropriate object of refined taste, and usefulness became rather a negative than a positive feature for a work of art. Art for Art\u2019s sake, the Artist as Visionary Genius, and the unique Aesthetic Attitude/Experience emerged as the distinguishing features of Fine Art.  New institutions devoted to the arts, such as galleries, museums, concert halls and libraries, were a central part of the new system.  The public had to learn that these were places where one must be quiet and devote one\u2019s sole attention to the work. (TIA pp. 143-144) Within the new system, Art was exalted, acquiring almost a religious significance by the nineteenth century, while craftwork was devalued and minimized, leaving room for the eventual emergence in the twentieth century of artists in whose work craft skills play no important role.  Alexander Baumgarten gave the new category of \u201cthe aesthetic\u201d its name in 1738.  Kant and Schiller firmed up the philosophical definition of the aesthetic at the end of the eighteenth century, Kant famously isolating aesthetic judgment from other sorts of appreciation of a work or a landscape, and likewise providing an enduring analysis of the eighteenth century categories of the Beautiful and the Sublime.  Shiner provides a fine review of this crucial passage in his chapter, \u201cFrom Taste to the Aesthetic.\u201d (TIA 130 \u2013 151)"}, "p_5358845363": {"origin": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00548cd", "text": " Popular culture, poetry, music and visual arts and the roles they play in our society.

It owes a great deal to the vocabulary of modern art.  It creates and conveys many cultural messages.  The symbolic weight and technical skill of contemporary design work frequently earn it a place in fine art museums.  It is also commercial, if anything is.  Industry, advertising, communication, and mass culture depend heavily on design for their power, as Stuart Ewen demonstrates in his classic All Consuming Images: The Politics of Style in Contemporary Culture.  [10] Design shapes us; in a way it gives us the feel of who we are.  It can work together with values we might approve to spread those values within the culture. The high end of the American office furniture industry, and the US Green Building Council with its LEED standards, do this with environmental values in their designs. Design work is skilled work; one trains for it in art school; one learns it as a craft.  In fact, it regularly embodies the supposedly contradictory values of free creativity and uniform mass production, since skilled, creative designers are constantly making new styles that are then rushed to market and sold to our desire for freedom and individuality.  Here, perhaps, an essential point about the \u201cpossibility of a third system\u201d comes unavoidably to the surface.

The modern system of the arts is very tightly intertwined with the economic and class structures of the modern way of life.  Poverty and class identity continue to limit both the access and the cultural capital necessary to understand and participate in the elite art world, and thus they continue to define sharp divisions within the arts, as in the rest of life.

So it is not surprising that practitioners of the exiled popular arts and the crafts (furniture makers, potters, popular musicians, movie-makers, graphic novelists, video-game designers, gourmet chefs, hairdressers, and many more) regularly try to climb over the wall and be acknowledged as Artists.  It\u2019s the only way to be taken seriously.

Modern ideas of art had not yet developed.  Beauty, in the traditional system, was both highly prized and so strongly connected with utility that Aquinas thought an artifact could not be beautiful if unsuited to its ordinary use. He gives the outlandish example of a glass saw which, he says, could not be beautiful because it would be useless (Summa Theologica I-II, 57, 3c, cited in TIA , p. 34).

But arguably the differences are great.  Several facts demonstrate this.  First, the modern system makes possible much that is genuinely new and would not be possible without it.  By the late nineteenth century this fact is obvious.  Most modernist work (the music of Schoenberg, the novels of James Joyce, the paintings of Mondrian, Kandinsky and Jackson Pollack) would be inconceivable without the development of the Fine Art idea.  For such works are valued as Art, independent of any overt social, economic, religious or practical function they might have.  [8] They demand intensely focused attention in order to be understood.

In it all Art is assumed to be of a kind, even though in the traditional system there would be no compelling reason to suppose that the disparate activities of music, painting, sculpture, architecture, and poetry (the five original \u201cfine arts) share a common essence, in contrast with occasional overlaps in respect to form, narrative, imitation, beauty, etc.  Arguably this assumption has directed the development of these arts (and of the others that have since been added to the group) in new ways, as well as setting possibly unsolvable challenges to aestheticians who are trying to define that common essence.  Internal contradictions arise most generally in regard to the relation of the arts to the rest of life, now that the modern system has forced a partial separation between the two.  For example, while often claiming universal human relevance and a transcendent mission, contemporary Fine Art in the modern period has become increasingly inaccessible to most people, for whom the role claimed by art is often filled by what Clement Greenberg disparagingly called Kitsch, or by a somewhat nostalgic attachment to classic works by early moderns like Van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne and Monet that were radical more than a century ago but now feel comfortable."}, "p_8456702021": {"origin": "http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519", "text": "In spite of such examples, I think we must recognize the truth of the point Paul Mattick makes so forcefully.  Artistic freedom, in the modern system, depends significantly on that to which it is opposed.  The more outr\u00e9  the work, the more this rule holds true.  The art market depends on large infusions of money from those same commercial forces, whether that money passes through the hands of individual buyers of art or is conveyed directly by corporate purchases and grants.  Its freedom does not pass to the poor.  It is not correct to say that the arts are pure ideology; they are very far from it.  But the unique ideas of the modern system, of art for art\u2019s sake, artistic genius, and the autonomous aesthetic come very close to being pure ideology.

A clear example of this is the 2002 name change of New York's American Museum of Craft to the Museum of Arts and Design.  In announcing the change, the director said \"craft\" is identified with hobbies and fairs and the Board president spoke of it as associated with \"trinkets.\"  (I'm indebted to Larry Shiner for this example.)  Replicating the invidious distinctions of the fine art paradigm within the world of craft in this way may be a regrettable development. But once again, assimilation of some craft by the modern system has its effect on the values of that system.  For functionality remains a crucial element in craftwork.  This is arguably true even in cases where it might seem not to be.  Craft museums, galleries, and craft shows of the kind that are gaining fine art status frequently include examples of nonfunctional objects.  Some are innocently non functional:  they are sculptures made from clay, fiber, or wood.  Some are \"in your face\u201d nonfunctional: the pitcher with a hole in its side, the impossible-to-drink-from \"Hairy Monster Goblet\" I once saw whose body (though not its base or stem) was entirely covered by extruded glass spines.  Such playful items shout \"I, too, am fine art!  You want me to be nonfunctional, fine!  I'm nonfunctional!  Pin a medal on me, you dope!\"  But the skill of the maker, the obvious ability to make items that combine beauty, grace, or meaning with utility, is always evident.  They come from a tradition where the elegant combination of form with function is highly valued.  Wendell Castle, often credited with founding the modern Fine Art Furniture movement, provides an excellent example.  He makes one-of-a-kind objects a person might want to display rather than use, but he also markets the Wendell Castle Collection, which, while a bit pricey, enables one to outfit one\u2019s living or dining room with some standard Castle designs (available only through selected galleries).  Thus, once again, the fine art idea has spread, this time into the fields of craft and commercial production which it was supposed to exclude.  But in the process it is being transformed to include some of those qualities whose exclusion has helped to define it."}, "p_8840100196": {"origin": "http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html", "text": "I have less patience with the numerous paintings\n    which are all in white, portraying nothing.

Since antiquity artists have attempted to throw off the slur of manual labour and present themselves as gifted intellectuals on a higher level than mere artisans or craftsmen. By the Romantic period Wordsworth claimed that poets were 'endowed with a greater knowledge of human nature and a more comprehensive soul than are supposed to be common in mankind'.

He does not say there is nothing in common between artists or artworks or arts criticism or the experience of art products in the West before and after the eighteenth century, or between the modern West and non-Western cultures.  [7] He does not imply that artisans in the old system could not express themselves, or create profound visions of life and the world.  That would not be a defensible position. Rather Shiner claims that art was divided  in the eighteenth century West.  It was this division that made possible the emergence of Art in the modern sense.  So attitudes we now have toward craftwork or interior decoration, and attitudes we now have toward fine art sculpture, might both be appropriate toward, say, a piece by Dellarobbia or a sculpture or salt-cellar by Cellini (TIA p. 38).  In many works from the past we recognize the same formal and substantive characteristics for which we now prize Fine Art.  Shiner\u2019s thesis does not imply that this must be a misrecognition.  He only warns that our perception of these past greats and their work, as well as our understanding of the practices and products of other cultures, can be distorted by the controlling power of the Fine Art paradigm.  They do not fit the Fine Art paradigm, and their works played a significantly different role in their cultures than Fine Art products play in ours."}}}
