The wikipedia definition of knowledge, which I think is the same as the standard philosophical view, is wrong. The idea is that information is distinguished from knowledge by conscious observation. This view totally neglects what is actually remarkable about human knowledge: it is highly adapted to solve problems. For example, the computer on which I am typing this is set up in such a way that if you make a change to it without understanding it you will break it. For example, if you change the design of its CPU or hard drive or any other piece of equipment without detailed knowledge of how it works it will turn into a useless piece of junk. But lots of non-human systems that existed long before people have the same property, e.g. - the chemical machinery in cells, the way eyes are put together and so on. So there has to be an explanation of this adaptation that applies not just to human knowledge but to the complexity in non-conscious systems like amoebae. The explanation is that both human knowledge and biological complexity arise by processes that involve variation and selection. It's appropriate to think of knowledge as being the property of being well adapted to solve problems, rather than thinking of it s well adapted information that happens to be in a human brain. For this reason and others Popper holds a theory of objective knowledge, much of which is not known by anybody.

What it does entail is that if information can be destroyed it can also be created \"out of nothing\", like the ball's elapsed time and direction of movement. The peculiarity of the dome is that self-initiation of motion requires no energy input here, not even an infinitesimal push. This is close to what free will libertarians want, free will acts as causa sui, and hence injects new information into causal chains.

Empriricism and positivism are both unavoidably ambiguous about what exists in reality because they do not and cannot have any clear explanation of what counts as an observation.

Also, nobody has ever seen a dinosaur, only fossils, so do dinosaurs exist? Empiricism and positivism both treat observation as a primitive: they are raw material to invent and prove ideas, but this makes no sense. Real observations have to be conducted by setting up a suitable physical system using an explanation of how the system works and it is adjusted until it is in a working state using that same explanation. Explanation is a result of a complicated chain of reasoning and can be used to test ideas but it can't provide you with ideas or prove them.
