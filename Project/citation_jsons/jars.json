None of the jars were broken, even when the contents were initially frozen or when all the jars were placed on a cold surface immediately after heating. However, splashing of the contents and/or jumping of the jar with a resulting loud clatter represented a major problem. Jumping of the jars and splashing of the contents depended on both the recipe and the consistency of the food and the shape of the jar, but less on the packaging material, the initial temperature or the heating time. The plastic and board containers also jumped and food splashed out of them. If glass jars or cylindrical/jar-like packages are to be used for the packaging of microwaveable foods, both the recipe of the foodstuffs and the shape of the jars need to be developed further."}, "p_2495826014": {"origin": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pts.2770060108/abstract", "text": "                         By continuing to browse this site you agree to us using cookies as described in About Cookies "}, "p_4639154732": {"origin": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pts.2770060108/abstract", "text": "                                                  View\u00a0                                                 issue TOC                                                                   Volume 6, Issue 1                         January/February 1993                                                      Pages 43\u201352                                                                                                                            "}, "p_5491920629": {"origin": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pts.2770060108/abstract", "text": "Please enable Javascript to view the related content of this article."}, "p_6032983804": {"origin": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pts.2770060108/abstract", "text": "                Request Permissions             "}, "p_6902381513": {"origin": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pts.2770060108/abstract", "text": "  Next article in issue:                                 News items from around the world                             "}, "p_8357247703": {"origin": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pts.2770060108/abstract", "text": "Powered by Wiley Online Library"}, "p_882121514": {"origin": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pts.2770060108/abstract", "text": "The suitability of glass jars for heating in microwave ovens was studied.
